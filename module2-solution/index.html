				<h4 id="t1">Vladimir Putin</h5>

				<div id="p1">
					<p>The world's most powerful person for four years running, Russia's president has exerted his country's influence in nearly every corner of the globe; from the motherland to Syria to the U.S. presidential elections, Putin continues to get what he wants. Unconstrained by conventional global norms, his reach has magnified in recent years. In 2016 Russian hackers were accused of tapping into email accounts owned by members of the U.S. Democratic Party in a bid to aid the campaign of Donald Trump, who has regularly praised Putin's leadership style. The Kremlin denies the charges, and President-elect Trump has also dismissed the possibility of outsiders tampering in the election, despite a reported CIA memo suggesting otherwise. Either way, with a likely ally entering the White House, Putin's power may go largely unchecked for years to come.</p>

				<h4 id="t2">Donald Trump</h5>
				<div id="p2">
					<p>Donald Trump became the first billionaire president in U.S. history in January 2017, but the business that made him rich remains intact. Today his sons Eric and Donald Jr. run the day-to-day operations. They have promised to separate the Trump Organization from the Trump presidency, but it's unclear whether that is actually happening. The president created a trust to park his properties -- which include office towers, private golf clubs and luxury hotels -- and Eric Trump told Forbes he will update his father on their financials "probably quarterly." Although the Trump name now extends around the world, the core of the president's fortune remains tied to a handful of buildings in midtown Manhattan in New York City. He got his start working with his father Fred, who developed low-cost housing in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>

				<h4 id="t3">Angela Merkel</h5>
				<div id="p3">
					<p>As populist, right-wing political movements spring up around the world, many have labeled Germany's Chancellor as the last bastion of Western liberal power. Merkel, who faces a challenging reelection bid in 2017, has been tasked with maintaining a united European front in the wake of Brexit, balancing growing Russian influence on the continent and managing more than 1 million migrants who have entered Germany in recent years. This is hardly the first difficult political climate Merkel has been dealt. She guided her country through a recession with stimulus packages and subsidies for companies that cut hours for workers, and Germany entered 2016 with a budget surplus of 12.1 billion euros ($13.1 billion) and an AAA rating from credit rating agencies. She has also used her power against ISIS, breaking the post-Nazi-era taboo of direct involvement in military actions by sending arms to Kurdish fighters.</p>
